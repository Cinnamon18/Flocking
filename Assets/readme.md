Flocking Project - Alice Moh
CS 4803-PCG Spring 2020

=== Exciting Features ===
 - First person character controller, sorta "minecraft style" flight (reused from 1st project)
 - Boyds wiggle their wings and tails in flight. It's an expression of a joy coefficient computed by a complicated psychology simulation neural network that produces results suspiciously similar to perlin noise.
 - Advanced boyd repusion algorithm scales repulsion force to infinity when boyds near clipping through eachother, rather than a simple function of their center differences
 - When creatures run off the edge of the world box, they're transported to the opposite side
 - Change creature count? Press space bar to see your new flock!
